        I.xor.ipynb
            a) Solution for XOR problem with only one fully conncected layer as hidden layer with two nodes.
            b) Parameters for MLPClassifier:
                    solver='lbfgs'
                    hidden_layer_sizes=(2)
                    activation='logistic'
                    alpha=0.002
                    random_state=2
            c)  Weights for neurons and intercept are:
                    [array([[ 5.12522891, -5.08959333],[-5.12354702,  5.09072276]]), array([[9.34316978],[9.34208937]])]
